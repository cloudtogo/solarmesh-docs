The cornerstone of SolarMesh is the service mesh theory, which is a tool for solving kubernetes network problems. SolarMesh's underlying architecture is powered by istio, a highly configurable and powerful open source service grid platform that is currently the most popular service grid implementation in the industry.

## basic concept

### What is Service Mesh?

Service Mesh, also translated as "service grid", serves as the infrastructure layer for communication between services. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles communication between services. It is responsible for reliably delivering requests through complex service topologies that encompass modern cloud-native applications. In practice, service meshes are typically implemented through a set of lightweight network proxies that are deployed alongside the application without being aware of the application itself.

Service Mesh is usually used to describe the microservice network of applications and the interaction between applications. It is an infrastructure layer. As the size and complexity of programs increase, service meshes become increasingly difficult to understand and manage. Its requirements include service discovery, load balancing, fault recovery, indicator collection, monitoring, and more complex operation and maintenance requirements, such as A/B testing, canary release, current limiting, access control, and end-to-end authentication.

If you explain what a service mesh is in one sentence, you can compare it to TCP/IP between applications or microservices, which is responsible for network calls, current limiting, circuit breaking, and monitoring between services. When writing applications, you generally do not need to care about the TCP/IP layer (such as RESTful applications through the HTTP protocol). When using a service grid, you do not need to care about the functions between services that are originally implemented through applications and frameworks, such as Spring Cloud and OSS. , now itâ€™s just a matter of handing it over to the service mesh.

### Characteristics of service mesh

The service mesh has the following characteristics:

* Middle layer for inter-application communication
  *Lightweight network proxy
  *Application-agnostic
* Decouple application retries, timeouts, monitoring, tracing and service discovery

### What does the service mesh bring us?

From the perspective of the general trend of cloud native, the core point of cloud native lies in abstraction. Just as virtual machines were once abstracted from physical machines, the essence of cloud-native applications is to abstract all infrastructure from the independent applications themselves to form middleware-level tools, such as networks.

The entire abstraction of the network layer allows us to carry out standardized and unified management, thereby deriving the means of solving problems at the network layer. This abstraction at the network level eliminates the need for us to resort to SDK means (such as Spring Cloud) to solve problems due to network insufficiency. For problems arising from stability (timeouts, retries, etc.), the SDK has a certain binding relationship with the language. In today's era of microservices where multiple languages coexist, the capabilities provided by the SDK are slightly insufficient.

The emergence of service mesh is to solve this problem, abstract the Kubernetes network, and provide language-independent enhancement methods. It is the middleware to solve Kubernetes network problems.
