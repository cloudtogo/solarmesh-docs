## Installing the demo program

If you haven't installed the demo program yet, Please refer to [Quick Start](../../quickstart/) to install Aeraki, Istio, and the demo.

After installation, you can see that the following two NSs have been added to the cluster, and the Dubbo and Thrift demo applications are installed in these two NSs. You can choose either of them to test.

```bash
➜  ~ kubectl get ns|grep meta
meta-dubbo        Active   16m
meta-thrift       Active   16m
```

Aeraki's rate limiting rules are designed to be flexible and easy to use, supporting both rate limiting for all inbound requests to a service and fine-grained rate limiting control based on specified conditions.

## Enforce rate limiting on all inbound requests of a service

The following rule limits all inbound requests to the thrift-sample-server.meta-thrift.svc.cluster.local service to 2 requests / minute.

```bash
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: metaprotocol.aeraki.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetaRouter
metadata:
  name: test-metaprotocol-thrift-route
  namespace: meta-thrift
spec:
  hosts:
  - thrift-sample-server.meta-thrift.svc.cluster.local
  localRateLimit:
    tokenBucket:
      fillInterval: 60s
      maxTokens: 2
      tokensPerFill: 2
EOF
```

> Note: Because local rate limiting is handled separately on each service instance, when the service has multiple instances, the actual rate limiting effect is the number of rate limiting times the number of instances.


Using the aerakictl command to view the client-side log, you can see that the client can only successfully send out 4 requests per minute (with two service instances, each limited to 2 requests per minute).

```bash
➜  ~ aerakictl_app_log client meta-thrift -f --tail 10

```

## Rate limiting by condition

Aeraki supports setting multiple rate limiting rules for a service, each with different conditions. This is super useful if you need to enforce fine-grained rate limiting on a service. For example, you can set different quota for users based on their SLA(Service Level Agreement).

Just like routing condtions, any attributes that can be extracted from the request packet can be used for the matching conditions of the rate limiting rule.

For example, the following rules set different rate limiting for the sayHello and ping interfaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: metaprotocol.aeraki.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetaRouter
metadata:
  name: test-metaprotocol-thrift-route
  namespace: meta-thrift
spec:
  hosts:
  - thrift-sample-server.meta-thrift.svc.cluster.local
  localRateLimit:
    conditions:
    - match:
        attributes:
          method:
            exact: sayHello
      tokenBucket:
        fillInterval: 60s
        maxTokens: 10
        tokensPerFill: 10
    - match:
        attributes:
          method:
            exact: ping
      tokenBucket:
        fillInterval: 60s
        maxTokens: 100
        tokensPerFill: 100
```

## Set rate limiting at both the service level and condition level

It is possible to set both service level and condition level rate limiting, which is useful when you need to set a global quota for the whole service, but with a few exceptions.

For example, the following rate limiting rule sets an overall rate limiting rule for the service of 1000 messages/minute, with an exception of 100 messages/minute for the ping interface.

```yaml
apiVersion: metaprotocol.aeraki.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetaRouter
metadata:
  name: test-metaprotocol-thrift-route
  namespace: meta-thrift
spec:
  hosts:
  - thrift-sample-server.meta-thrift.svc.cluster.local
  localRateLimit:
    tokenBucket:
      fillInterval: 60s
      maxTokens: 1000
      tokensPerFill: 1000
    conditions:
    - match:
        attributes:
          method:
            exact: ping
      tokenBucket:
        fillInterval: 60s
        maxTokens: 100
        tokensPerFill: 100
```

## Understand what happened

In the configuration sent to the Sidecar Proxy, Aeraki sets the MetaProtocol Proxy in the FilterChain corresponding to the service in the VirtualInbound Listener.

Aeraki translates the rate limiting rules configured in the MetaRouter into configuration for the local rate limit filter, and distributes the configuration to sidecar proxies.

The configuration of the service's sidecar proxy can be viewed with the following command.

``` bash
aerakictl_sidecar_config server-v1 meta-thrift |fx
```

The configuration of the MetaProtocol Proxy in the Inbound Listener of the Thrift service is shown below.
